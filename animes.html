		<p id = "p">What seems like a boring anime with a pink haired protagonist on surface level, The Disastrous Life of Saiki K surprises you with an 
		interesting take on what it’s truly like being an all powerful being trying to navigate high school life. The plot centres around Kusuo
		Saiki and his desire for a peaceful and average lifestyle, however the daily antics of his high school friends and surrounding community 
		get him in situations that require the use of some of his many abilities and powers (you just have to watch it to know how many). 
		This entire story plays out while there is an underlying threat of the world being destroyed (which Saiki is preventing through his
		ability to revert things to their original state temporarily, again you just have to watch it to understand the extent of his powers)
		which I thought provided a well thought out and creative twist to an otherwise mundane comedy anime. The one problem this anime does
		have is it’s lack of memorable cast surrounding Saiki (other than the main supporting characters), due to an overplayed use of a new
		transfer student course of events, however I feel that they account for this weakness by having the new students coming in be given
		supernatural abilities like talking to ghosts or telling peoples future. Overall, I feel that this anime is a must watch and primarily 
		falls short in the aspect that a new season hasn’t come out yet!</p>

	not stable condition as she was turned to a demon. Tanjiro made it as his goal to do whatever it takes in order to revert his sister back to normal. Tanjiro 
	goes on a journey and becomes a demon slayer to find the cure for his sister. The anime gives watchers the exhilarating feeling on Tanjiro's determination on to
	protect the only family he has. As well as the amazing animation which makes the fights more exciting to watch. However, the one problem is that the anime has is 
	the character development. The characters have become a generic shounen character where the character acquiring new things to be able to successful in their goal. 
	Overall, I feel like this anime has a great animation which results into sucking in the viewer, but the poor character development makes the anime fall short on 
	the potential it has to become one of the best animes to be released this decade.</p>
